# JPN n3DS Browser Filter Toggle Script

## Introduction
The JPN New3DSes have content filtering that is extremely restrictive, to the point where it blocks Spotify because it is "streaming: music". (I wonder what kind of mature content I can find there ðŸ‘€). In order to remove the content filter, Nintendo _required_ that you pay a tiny amount of money via credit card. But now? You can't remove it at all, because they've stopped supporting credit cards on the eShop. So, here's a GodMode9 script to toggle the content filter.  

## Versions
Both \_en.gm9 and \_ja.gm9 do the same thing, but messages in \_en.gm9 are in English and those in \_ja.gm9 are in Katakana.

## Requirement
\_en.gm9: GodMode9 v1.9.2pre1 or above.
\_ja.gm9: GodMode9 v2.1.0 or above.

## Note
You must have opened the browser at least once before using this script so that the savedata exists to modify.  

## License

For more details, see `LICENSE`.

## Disclaimer
The script modifies a certain part of the browser's savedata.  
Although I have confirmed it did disable and enable the filtering without visible trace of detection by the browser, I cannot assertively deny the possibility that the browser is aware of it, or that a future version of the browser can detect it.  
Please use this script at your own risk.
